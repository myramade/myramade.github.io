# MyraMade VR MakerLab

**Description**: This **MakerLab** consists of three individual labs that increase in complexity. **Lab 1** gets you building simple VR experience in under 5 minutes, from there we move on to **Lab 2** building a **WebVR** experience, then finish in **Lab 3** building a **Navtive VR** experinece. Each lab makes use of a different VR creator tool, however, there is *NO* coding experience required. 

**Audience**: Learning Experience Designers, Instructional Designers, Instructional Design Developers, Learning Scientist

**Required Skills**: To complete these labs you must be have some basic computer skills and be able to download, upload, copy, and paste files from/to a web browser. For Labs 2 & 3, you should be able to have some basic storyboarding skills, however, be warned - storyoarding for VR is NOT like storyboarding for video or elearning. 

**Goal**: The goal of this lab is to build the required knowledge to design a virtual reality (VR) experience for learning

## VR Terminology
There are a few terms you need to add to your vocabulary when it comes to VR. Visit the [VR Glossary](http://www.vrglossary.org/)for more indepth terminology

Terminology | Definition
------------|-----------------
Agency | this is the act of interacting with objects in a virtual space such as moving an item or causing change
Eye Tracking | this is one way of selecting items in a VR space, the user uses two crosshairs in the VR space to select items by looking at the item and ensuring the crosshairs are on the item and then holding their gaze on the item for a few seconds
Field of View | an important design aspect of VR, Field of View (FOV) is the user's visual span while rotaing their heads from one position to another
Homeworld | this is the first scene in your VR scnenario, it's your VR landing page. 
Head mounted display | this is the headset that is doned by the VR user it can be stand-alone such as a Google Cardboard that uses a smartphone and the new Occulus Go where the VR experience lives in the device itself or tethered such as an Occulus Rift or HTC Vive which must be connected to a computer to work deliver the VR experience
WebVR | a VR experience that is delivered via the web (internet). It's tool and device agnostic.  
CAVE | is an acronym for *cave automatic virtual environment* it's an enviroment made up ofr three to six walls that form a cube that uses projectors to display a virtual world on the walls and is controlled by the movement of the users within the CAVE
Presence | this is an important concept in VR. presence is achieved when the users is completely immersed in the virual world ignoring and many times unaware of what's going on int he physical world
Cinematic VR | a VR experience that uses 360 video and images instead of 3D graphics
Data Glove | this is an interactive device that connects to a computer, the users uses it to manipulate items in the VR world
Haptic | you've experienced haptics on your smartphone when you first purchased it and dialed numbers of sent a text message, its the sensation of touch and pressure on keys, this technology is also used in the VR space to support Agency


## Assets
In order to create our VR experiences, you will need to assets that you can use to create your experience. I have created a number of assets that you can use to create your experience.  You can find additional assets at one of the following websites:
1. [Myra's 360 Asset Folders](https://github.com/mirarol/mirarol.github.io/tree/master/vr/assets)
2. [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=equirectangular&tbm=isch&tbs=isz:l&cad=h)

## Resources
These labs are part of a workshop that I faciliate. In this repo, I will not go over how to capture 360 images and video. However, there are several resource you can find by a simple Google search. However, here are some reference materials and equipment I recommend:
