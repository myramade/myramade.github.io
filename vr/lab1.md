## Lab 1 - Viewer
**Level of Difficulty: Easy**

In this lab we will be using the [Cardboard VR Photo Sphere Viewer](https://sphcst.com/upload). 

You should have already downloaded your asset, if you haven't done so now is a good time. You can grab the URL of a single 360 image assset from one of the following locations:
1. [Myra's 360 Asset Folders](https://github.com/mirarol/mirarol.github.io/tree/master/vr/assets)
2. [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=equirectangular&tbm=isch&tbs=isz:l&cad=h)
3. [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/groups/equirectangular/)
4. [Photopin](http://photopin.com/free-photos/equirectangular)

Once you have your asset downloaded or an asset link, you are ready to begin.

2. Do one of the following: Upload your 360 image or enter the URL of your 360 image. 
*Note: If you are using one of my assets found here in my Github repo, you'll need to click click on the image name to open it and then select **Copy Path**. This will copy the URL for the image, you can simply paste it onto the Google Cardboard site.*
